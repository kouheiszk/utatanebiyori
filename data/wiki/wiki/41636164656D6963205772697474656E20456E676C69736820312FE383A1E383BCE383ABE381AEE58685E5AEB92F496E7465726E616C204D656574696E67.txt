Dear Mr. Smith,

I am preparing to start a new project, and would like to ask you for the technical advice before I start. I would like to meet with you for about 30 minutes on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss the project. Please let me know what time is convenient for you.

I appreciate your assistance, thank you in advance.

Best regards,
