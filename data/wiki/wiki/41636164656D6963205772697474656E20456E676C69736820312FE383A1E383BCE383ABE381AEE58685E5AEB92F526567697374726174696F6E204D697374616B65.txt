Dear Prof. Roy,

My name is Suzuki Kouhei. Std No.0000000. I am a 1st year student at UEC.

I am E-mailing you to tell you about a mistake I have made. My apologies for any inconvenience.

I have registered for Professor Suzuki’s A.S.E.1 class, 6th period on Friday’s by mistake.
I want to join your A.W.E.1 class, 3rd period on Saturday’s.

I will go to the student affairs office ASAP, and re-register for your class. I hope you can accept me into your class.

Please let me know your decision.

Best regards,
Dentsu Taro
